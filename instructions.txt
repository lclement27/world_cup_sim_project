Here are the instructions for my World Cup Simulator!!

Using it is very simple and only involves a few steps by the user

Step 1: Run Main.java
	* This will start the application and give control to the Controller
	* This will also create the view
	
Step 2: Upload your file with your desired teams and match-ups
	* When creating the file, the order matters, so adjacent teams will play each other
	* The teams should also be in a format of "rank. name" (e.g. "1. Brazil")
	* Select your file with the finder and then the GUI will be updated with the data!
	
Step 3: Press the 'Play Next Round' button
	* Pressing this will progress the round and display the winners of the games 
	
Step 4: Keep pressing until you reach the winner of the World Cup!
	* The winner is the last team standing
	
Congrats on simulating the World Cup!
